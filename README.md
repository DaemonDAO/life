Conway's Game of Life (hereafter LIFE) as a perpetual, evolving blockchain superorganism

LIFE is a demonstration of how complexity can be borne of simplicity, with parallels to the simple cells that are the building blocks of complex organic life.

LIFE is a zero-player game, featuring a 2-D matrix of cells that can exist in two states, alive or dead. Upon each timestep, with each timestep, all cells in LIFE evolve with the following rules that depend on the state of their eight neighbours (above, below and diagonal):

- If a cell is alive, then it remains alive if it has either 2 or 3 live neighbours. Otherwise, it dies (underpopulation/overpopulation)
- If a cell is dead, then it springs to life only in the case that it has 3 live neighbours (reproduction)



The concept: A perpetual LIFE instance on the blockchain
